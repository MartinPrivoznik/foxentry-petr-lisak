Backend application to help mr. Petr Lisak manage his store

## Running application

First, install node packages with `npm install`. Then you need to create ***.env*** file. There is an example of env file in the solution.
Env file should contain MongoDB connection string and application port if needed. To execute unit tests, you need to create ***.env.test*** file, which can be similar.
However, your unit test database user needs a database deletion rights to clean up after running tests.
